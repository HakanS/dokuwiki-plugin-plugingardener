PluginGardener Plugin for DokuWiki

This plugin downloads plugin homepages from dokuwiki.org and
also tries to create a local copy of each plugin. 

The plugin has been used to create the plugin surveys,
see http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:plugin_survey:start,

If you are tempted to run it, please read to code first.
You probably have to increase timeouts/memorylimits etc
to get it working. CLOC and other tools are not included.
